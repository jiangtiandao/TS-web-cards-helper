TS-web-cards-helper is a lightway web app, that helps to play boardgame Twilight Struggle.
===================
The Twilight struggle game itself is ranked first in world wide ranking http://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame/page/1?sort=rank

===================
Main reason for developing this app
===================
- there is about 100 cards in game, if you remember which cards have already been played, you are in better position
- many cards target specific countries. So it will be nice to reverse it and to have a fast overview of all possibble cards targeting my country

===============
Where it can be used?
===============
I usually play online using vassal engine.

Current version is hosted at 
http://angelo.hostingasp.pl/index.html and http://angelo.hostingasp.pl/map.html (its playable but under development)

Technologies used
===============
JavaScript, KnockoutJS, (TypeScript). (probably will evolve towards Single Page Application).

Hover over a country and you will see cards that are somehow connected to this country.
